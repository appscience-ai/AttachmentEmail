# AttachmentEmail
 
 Add Email Attachment with a drag and drop.

 This custom control if just an amendment of this one : https://github.com/BenLBartle/PCF-AttachmentsGrid

You can install it by import :
   - the mangaged solution : \AttachmentEmail_Solution\bin\Release\AttachmentEmail_Solution.zip
   - the unmanaged solution : \AttachmentEmail_Solution\bin\debug\AttachmentEmail_Solution.zip

# Improvement
 
 - Currently the custom control doesn't work on the creation form, we need to save and refresh the page.
